&lt;p&gt;The translation layer between customers and engineers is compressing. When agents can convert well-formed problems into working code, PMs shift from writing specs for engineers to forming intent clearly enough that agents can act directly. &lt;strong&gt;The spec is becoming the product.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-new-pm-skillset"&gt;The New PM Skillset&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Problem Shaping (The Primary Skill)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take ambiguous customer pain and shape it into something agents can act on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify constraints that actually matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Articulate what success looks like concretely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold ambiguity longer—explore the solution space before collapsing to a single approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2025 is the year code stopped being the scarce thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With agentic development tools: Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and others - engineers can now generate huge amounts of software: prototypes, migrations, refactors, tests, docs, analysis scripts, and all the glue work we used to put off. The daily experience of programming has shifted. Less time typing, more time directing and reviewing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>High Impact Teams - Engineering Culture</title><link>https://toamitkumar.in/2022/05/15/high-impact-teams/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://toamitkumar.in/2022/05/15/high-impact-teams/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I have always wondered what makes a group of people (either cross-functional or similar skills) become high performant or a &lt;strong&gt;High Impact&lt;/strong&gt; team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google researchers wanted to understand the secrets of effective teams. Hence, the researchers initiatied a project code-named &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Project Aristotle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, following the quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that great teams are not driven by free lunches, great benefits, or wonderful salaries. &lt;em&gt;What really mattered was less about who is in the team but more about how the team works together&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; is at the foundation level for any product or service platform. It starts from the lowest level i.e. bare metal to servers to storage to networking.
In a cloud setup, all of these &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-is-cloud-infrastructure" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;resources are abstracted&lt;/a&gt; and you treat the resources as service components served through either console or APIs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dkatalis.co" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DKatalis&lt;/a&gt; is an engineering setup and hence, we had our tech stack on the bleeding edge for Financial services - &lt;a href="https://flutter.dev/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dart (Flutter)&lt;/a&gt; for FE, server-side JS (NodeJS) for BE, Kafka (service communication and data streams), APIGW (Tyk), MongoDB, Redis, CloudFlare, ELK, Dynatrace &amp;amp; Solarwinds, Terraform (IAC) &amp;amp; full cloud setup to just name a few.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Building an Engineering setup for a Financial Service Institution</title><link>https://toamitkumar.in/2022/01/02/building-engineering-setup-financial-services/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://toamitkumar.in/2022/01/02/building-engineering-setup-financial-services/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I have been part of building Product &amp;amp; Engineering teams and Digital Transformation setup for almost more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first experience was during the build of MDL (McKinsey Digital Labs) by our leaders: &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sattybhens" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Satty Bhens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bijubhaskar/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Biju Bhaskar&lt;/a&gt; - a startup-like setup (for both engineering and business building) inside a large organisation.
Both strongly believe in a garage-like setup and gave full support to establish guard-rails in protecting the culture of working as a startup.
Together, we built a solid team of 50-70 engineers (today MDL is more than 200 globally) following the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoke%E2%80%93hub_distribution_paradigm" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hubs-spokes&lt;/a&gt; model knitted together with an &lt;strong&gt;Engineering Mindset&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; connected via various communication tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Re-Engineer v/s Rewrite</title><link>https://toamitkumar.in/2021/11/24/reengineer-vs-rewrite/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://toamitkumar.in/2021/11/24/reengineer-vs-rewrite/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We are engineers (can be safely generalised to humans), who at heart enjoy &lt;strong&gt;building not extending/enhancing/improving&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy extending/enhancing. I strongly believe in the philosophy of &amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;You touch it, you improve it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is driven by the fact - programmers think old code is messy as &lt;a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/"&gt;Joel Spolsky&lt;/a&gt; writes &amp;ndash; It’s harder to read code than to write it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team formation, functioning, reporting are the most common challenges every organisation have. Lately, I have been involved in discussions related to Team Autonomy. Hence, this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy"&gt;Autonomy&lt;/a&gt; has different meaning based on context: political, medical, HR, organisation. Narrowing our focus to an Organisation, it has a wide spectrum from highly-organised (CMM levels or SixSigmas) to an Anarchical setup (a budding startup). I have never been a fan of being at the edge of the spectrum, it has its own consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Managing multiple SSH Keys with Github &amp; Gitlab</title><link>https://toamitkumar.in/2012/08/05/manage-multiple-ssh-github-gitlab/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Aug 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://toamitkumar.in/2012/08/05/manage-multiple-ssh-github-gitlab/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I have always stumbled on this problem of managing SSH keys for multiple Git based SCM (Gitlab, GitHub) including multiple GitHub accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
