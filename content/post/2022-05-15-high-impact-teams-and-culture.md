I have always wondered what makes a group of people (either cross-functional or similar skills) become high performant or a **High Impact** team.
<!-- I was recently in a team-building exercise where we discussed the traits of a **High Impact Team**.  -->

Google researchers wanted to understand the secrets of effective teams. Hence, the researchers initiatied a project code-named **{{< link_target_blank href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/" title="Project Aristotle" >}}**, following the quote:

> the whole is greater than the sum of its parts

They found that great teams are not driven by free lunches, great benefits, or wonderful salaries. _What really mattered was less about who is in the team but more about how the team works together_. They devised five traits of an effective 

#### Five traits of an effective team:
- _Psychological safety_: a belief that a team is safe for risk-taking and not seen as ignorant, incompetent, negative, or disruptive
- _Dependability_: which has been one of the important guiding principles - [Predictability](/2022/01/02/building-engineering-setup-financial-services/#4-be-predictable) 
- _Structure and clarity_: clarity of responsibilities, direction, and objectives.
- _Meaning_: personal and can vary: financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, or self-expression
- _Impact_: seeing that one’s work is contributing to the organization’s goals and can help reveal impact.

These traits are heavily dependent on the _culture of the organisation_ - a topic that has fascinated me, because I have been in a few transformative journeys including [building an Engineering](/2022/01/02/building-engineering-setup-financial-services/) setup from scratch. But, let me first explain how I define **culture**.

### What is culture?
It is important to understand what is _culture_ (a term that is used loosely for behaviors in the organisation). 

To me:
> Culture is an outcome of principles and corresponding practices followed by the team (or an organisation)

It won't be wrong to say, culture drives how a team (or an ogranisation) responds to challenges (internal or external) and opportunities it encounters.

#### Communication flows
One of the other important measures of culture is communication flows. Commnication has 3 aspects to a recepient: **relevance, timeliness & appropriateness**. Hence, it won't be wrong to say, information flow is driven by **typology** of the organisation. I came across an *interesting paper* on {{<link_target_blank href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1765804/pdf/v013p0ii22.pdf" title="organisational typology">}}. The paper describes 3 typologies:

1. **Pathological**: communication stops due to political reasons (power or glory)
2. **Bureaucratic**: communication moves slowly due to ogranisational boundaries (rules, position, departmental fences)
3. **Generative**: communication concentrates on the mission and arrives to the relevant people fastest

> Good communication flow builds cooperation, creativity, and safety.

#### How typology impacts the traits of effective teams
Typology of an organisation drives activities such as `communication, cooperation, innovation, and problem solving`. Let's look at how typology impacts the traits of effective teams.

##### _Psychological safety_
When things go wrong:
- _pathological_ setup encourage finding a `scapegoat`
- _bureaucratic_ organisation `seek justice`. Thinking may stop at the department’s turf because of the mindset: `it is not my concern`
- the _generative_ ones tries to discover the root cause within the system (strives to be ***blameless***). People are encouraged to speak up, think outside the box, and to act as fully conscious participants in a great cooperative enterprise

##### _Structure and clarity_
- in _pathological_ power struggles are the focus of awareness
- _bureaucratic_ setup constricts awareness by personal or departmental function
- in a _generative_ organisation, team members are made aware about the situation - what is happening and why.

##### Meaning and Impact
- in _pathological_ organisations, alignment is typically with a person or a {{<link_target_blank href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique" title="clique">}}.
- in a _bureaucratic_ organisation, alignment with the person’s own unit or function takes preference over alignment with the mission.
- in a _generative_ organisation, alignment takes place through identification with the mission. 

### What practices shape an Engineering Culture?
Both [Project Aristotle]({{< relref path="2022-05-15-high-impact-teams-and-culture.md#five-traits-of-an-effective-team">}}) & the [paper]({{< relref path="2022-05-15-high-impact-teams-and-culture.md#communication-flows">}}) explain how communication shapes three key variables: **alignment, awareness, and empowerment**. 

Let's come back to the statement:

**Culture is an outcome of principles and corresponding practices followed by the team (or an organisation)**

##### What practices matter?

###### Some of the engineering practices that really matter
- Pair programming, TDD, RFC (& ADR), 
- Write testable code
- Run the build and tests in a CI process
- Use test pyramids. Read this wonderful article by Martin Fowler
- Build once, promote further (deploy automatically or by the click of a button)
- Error and exception handling (system, business, integration)
- Make your systems Observable (and auditable)
- Performance and Security are features in the backlog (took a lot of time for us to bring this practice in-place, still WIP)
- Infrastructure and configurations are code (run them in a fully automated pipeline)
- Blameless post-mortems
- Brown bag sessions (knowledge sharing)

###### Behavrioral practices 

- Coaching & mentoring (1:1s)
- Earn trust
- Celebrate differences
- Open door policy
- Obligation to dissent
- Team over Individual
- Idea over hierarchy

###### People/ capability related practices

- 360 performance management
- Career Ladder
- Open Source (meet-ups, conferences, webinar)
- Meritocratic environment
- Diversify talent

## Conclusion

To build an environment of safety and culture (engineering), you have to actually **mean it and live it**!
It's always about PEOPLE, there is no culture without the people. It is by them and for them.

There are some important questions that I leave behind:
- Can different functions in an organisation have different culture?
- How does culture attract talent? How do you define culture to an interviewee?
- Can you tangibly measure culture?
- Do company values have influence on culture?
- Can you document culture?

> Culture (including Engineering) keeps on evolving

**Do it only if you feel passionate about**
